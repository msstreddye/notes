Currently, this implementation is focused on Vision, but the architecture and design must be scalable to support Medical, Dental, and Vision in the future. Ensure that any future enhancements require minimal changes and remain easy to maintain.

1) Vision JSON Verification

UI Rendering Check
Verify that the provided metadata JSON renders the UI exactly as shown in the attached image. As UI changes were done, just for rendering.

Validation Check
Confirm that the JSON includes all validations listed in the Vision Excel sheet and that it matches the design precisely.

Mismatch Handling
If any discrepancies are found, update the JSON to match the expected UI and validation rules.

Name Field Dependencies
To maintain compatibility for data export and integration with consumers, check the benplanlib-plan API for any dependencies on the name field.

If dependencies exist, update the name fields accordingly.

Clarifications
If any part of the requirement is unclear, discuss with me before proceeding further.

Tools & Testing
Use MCP tools wherever needed.
Finally, compare the updated Vision UI to ensure that:

It matches the expected design.

All scenarios are covered.

Validations work correctly.

You can use Chrome DevTools to test updates in real time using the mock Vision JSON thatâ€™s already in place. Use mysql mcp if you need to check db.
